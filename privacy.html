            </ul>

            <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
            <p>The Chateau Archive Player app stores all data locally on your device. This includes:</p>

            <h2>App Permissions</h2>

            <p>These permissions are used solely for the app's core functionality and are not used to collect any personal information.</p>

            <h2>Interaction with Archive.org</h2>
